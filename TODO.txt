TODO: remove these lines from ExtendedNumerics.hpp --

  // TODO remove this it's wrong
  friend int64_t operator-(int64_t left, const Numeric &right) {
    return left - right.internal_representation_.asFixnum();
  }

They are only there to prevent compiler optimization in benchmarking, 
and I'm not even sure they're needed anymore.

TODO: optimize fixnum multiplication to check if the result will fit 
into an int64 by using the log2_64 function in util.hpp.

TODO: Have the benchmarks print out flat data and do the analysis on the
    data later rather than as they go. This will allow the data to be used
    in ways that are unforeseen as of now.
