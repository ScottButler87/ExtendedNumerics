TODO: optimize fixnum multiplication to check if the result will fit
  into an int64 by using the log2_64 function in util.hpp. This is safe
  because in an x_bit * y_bit operation, an overestimate of the
  size of the result is {x+y} bits

TODO: Have the benchmarks print out flat data and do the analysis on the
  data later rather than as they go. This will allow the data to be used
  in ways that are unforeseen as of now.
